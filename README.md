# Comp_Music

Sitting in a cafe or restaurant, music has a big influence on the atmosphere. Working in a cafe myself, I use a lot of spotify playlists. During the day it will be in the trend of 'Coffee House', in the evening more jazz and in the late hours a rock party. I want to find out what aspects of this music makes them more enjoyable on different parts of the day. For this I will use the playlists we play at my work and compare these with each other. 

This will start with a comparison of genre, which will be very different. The first thing that stood out to me is that one of the playlists contains a whole album, which is not like the other playlists. Unfortunately, I am in isolation with covid and cannot copy the playlists at my work this week. I will copy these this weekend and ellaborate on the details of the songs and artists.

Another idea is to choose one part of the day, and compare the different playlists. This means the genre will be kind of the same, but with small differences in artists and songs.
