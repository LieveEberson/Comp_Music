<h3>Corpus</h3>
<p>Sitting in a cafe or restaurant, music has a big influence on the atmosphere. Working in a cafe myself, I use a lot of spotify playlists. In this cafe we have different playlists for different moments of the day. For my corpus in this research I chose our lunchtime and after dinnertime playlists. I want to find out what aspects of this music makes them more enjoyable on different parts of the day. For this I will compare these two playlists with each other. Beforehand, I would expect differences mostly in the tempo and energy of the tracks. Looking at valence, I would expect more neutral or a bit more negative songs for the lunch playlists. For the evening playlist I would expect the songs to be a bit more positive, because during this time people are drinking more alcohol and maybe going to a party afterwards.</p>
<ul>
<li>beschrijven van verschillen tussen playists. En verwachte verschillen.</li>
</ul>
<p>To investigate the differences I make use of a variation of visualisations and spotify features. First I will visualize track-level features for songs in both playlists. Secondly I will analyse the chroma features of both playlists by using chromagrams.</p>

<p>For the first plot, I put valence and energy on the axes. The size of the dots represent the loudness of the tracks. In the plot you can see that the tracks of the evening playlist are predominantly higher in energy, as I expected. The valence is also higher, so closer to the value 1. This means that the track are more positively in their nature. The lunch playlist is very linearly divided. In this playlist it seems that there is a connection between valence and energy. When the valence is higher, so the track is more positive, the energy of the track is also higher.</p>
<p>Also in the size of the dots there is a big difference. The dots of the lunch playlist are almost all relatively small, where the dots of the evening playlists are more divided. But, you can see that the loudness in the evening playlist seems to be higher. These three track based features show that the evening playlist scores higher in valence, energy and loudness. These were results I expected, because they fit in with the atmossphere created in a restaurants at these times of day. During lunch it is nice to have calmer, more quiet atmossphere. In the evening people like to be more energised and ready for the night ahead. For the next part I want to investigate chroma and timbre based features.</p>

<p>In these plots you can see chroma and timbre based features for a song of both playlists. I wanted to pick a random track, because the research is about the playlists in general. So all tracks are a representation of the atmosphere created by the playlist. I chose for both playlists the 5th track of the playlist. For the lunch playlist this is ‘At last’ from Etta James, for the evening playlist this is ‘Doom and Gloom’ from The Rolling Stones.</p>
<p>For ‘At last’ the chroma based matrix does not show distinct changes. The timbre based matrix shows one distinct moment at 140-150. Listening to the song you can hear that the piano is very repetitive during the song. At this moment however, the piano uses a different melody. For ‘Doom and Gloom’ the chroma based matrix again is hard to read for distinct changes. However, the timbre based matrix shows several clear moments where the music changes. This is at 60 and 150. At 60, there is a short guitar solo. At 150, after a period of instrumental music the singing starts again, but all instruments except the drums stop playing.</p>
<p>Altough these matrices may not show a lot of difference between the playlists, the instruments used do seem distinctive to me. The piano suits better with calmer, softer music as we saw in the lunch playlist on the previous page. The drums suit better with energetic, louder music like we saw in the evening playlist. However, all instruments fit with different tempos. That is why in the next part I am looking at the tempo of the playlists.</p>

<p>The histograms show the tempo of the tracks of the playlists for minor and major. You can see that in the evening playlist the tracks are predominantly in major. This fits with the findings regarding valence. The tracks are expected to be more positive and a major key is happier than a minor key. For the lunch playlist the tracks are more evenly divided, which corresponds with the findings regarding valence as well.</p>
<p>Tempo of the lunch playlist is found mostly around 100 bpm. The tempo of the evening playlist pushes it more to 140 bpm. This shows that the tempo of the tracks of the evening playlist seem to be generally higher than the lunch playlist. I think this fits well with the atmosspere during these times of day. When eating lunch, it is not nice to feel rushed. A lower tempo is more suitable. During the evening when having a beer, it is nice to get more hyped up and stay awake. A higher tempo supports this better. For the next part ??.</p>

<h3>Dendogram for the lunch playlist</h3>

<p>For this dendogram I created an extra playlist. In this playlist I combined tracks from both playlist, 10 tracks of each. I want to investigate if these tracks will be clustered with tracks from the same playlist.</p>
<p>In the heatmap there are four clusters to be found and three loose tracks. The first cluster scores low in instrumentalness and high in valence and accousticness. This cluster exists of three tracks from the lunch playlist. The second cluster scores higher in danceability and valence. This cluster exists of 4 tracks from the lunch playlist and 1 from the evening playlist. The first two clusters are also clustered together higher up.</p>
<p>The third cluster scores very high in energy and loudness. Compared to the other clusters it scores lower on accousticness and a bit higher in tempo and valence. The cluster entails 4 tracks from the evening playlist and 1 from the lunch playlist. The last cluster has higher values for speechiness and loudness, and lower values for accousticness. This cluster has 2 tracks of the evening playlist and 1 of the lunch playlist. The third and fourth cluster are clustered together higher up.</p>
<p>It seems like the dendogram clusters the tracks pretty good together based on their playlist. The features that seem most distinctive for this division are accousticness and energy. Energy was already looked at in the first step of the research. Accousticness however remains still an uninvestigated feature. Therefore I created a last page to take accousticness in account.</p>

<hr />
<p>The graphs show something I expected after the dendogram. Acousticness there was higher for the clusters with more tracks from the lunch playlist, and lower for the clusters with tracks from the evening playlist. Here we can see that there is a high density around lower values for acousticness for the evening playlist. However, the density for the lunch playlist is more evenly spread. So the difference in accousticness is more based on the absence of acousticness in the evening playlist than a big presence of acousticness in the lunch playlist.</p>
